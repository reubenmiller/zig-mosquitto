# Version Release, aka revision.
# This will expand any env var you set in the field, e.g. release: ${REVISION}
# This is appended to the `version` after `prerelease`. This should be

# and it should reset to 1 when bumping the version.

  An Open Source MQTT v3.1/v3.1.1 Broker

  Mosquitto is an open source message broker that implements the MQ Telemetry
  Transport protocol version 3.1 and 3.1.1 MQTT provides a lightweight method
  of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it
  suitable for "machine to machine" messaging such as with low power sensors
  or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or micro-controllers
  like the Arduino.
